## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Project Notes and Dependencies

The stopwatch code was borrowed from [https://codepen.io/_Billy_Brown/pen/dbJeh](https://codepen.io/_Billy_Brown/pen/dbJeh).

The project can be run using nodejs by running `node index.js` from the project root. It contains a simplistic express.js http server. You will need to do `npm install` to get the node dependencies. This is optional since the index.html file can just be opened directly in a browser if desired.
